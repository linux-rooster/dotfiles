# My SwayWM Dotfiles
I've been trying out Sway and i like it more than Hyprland now.\
Hope you like these dotfiles.\
These are completely free to reproduce, use as your own, and modify.\
You can also use them in your own repos.\
The ones marked as red are required in my swayWM config.
## Utilities
- <span style="color: #FF0000">waybar (status bar)</span>
- <span style="color: red">swww (wallpaper utility)</span>
- <span style="color: red">wlogout (wayland logout menu)</span>
- <span style="color: red">wayland-logout (logout button in wlogout)</span>
- <span style="color: red">wezterm (terminal)</span>
- <span style="color: red">thunar (file manager)</span>
- starship (terminal prompt)
- <span style="color: red">rofi-wayland (app launcher)</span>
- <span style="color: red">wl-clipboard (clipboard for wayland)</span>
- <span style="color: red">dunst (notification service)</span>
- <span style="color: red">grim and slurp (screenshotting utilities. both are required.)\</span>
the sway config file also uses Bibata-Modern-Classic xcursor theme, so make sure to download that.
